# Introduction to Docker

Docker is an open-source platform designed to simplify application deployment by using containers. 
Once a Docker container is built, it can run consistently across any environment—whether it's Windows, Linux, or macOS, on a laptop, in a data center, or in the cloud.

This approach is known as “Build Once, Run Anywhere.”

## Example: Running Nginx in a Docker Container

To demonstrate Docker’s portability, let’s use the Nginx web server:

## Basic Commands


## Docker Commands and Their Explanations

| Command                             | Explanation                                                              |

| `docker pull nginx`                 | Downloads the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub to your local machine.    |
| `docker images`                     | Lists all Docker images available locally.                                 |
| `docker run -dt -p 80:80 nginx`     | Runs Nginx in detached mode, mapping host port 80 to container port 80.    |
| `docker run -dt -p 8080:80 nginx`   | Runs Nginx in detached mode, mapping host port 8080 to container port 80.  |
| `docker run -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 -dt nginx`   
| Binds Nginx to all network interfaces, useful in cloud environments.       |
| `docker ps`                         | Lists only the currently running containers.                               |
| `docker ps -a`                      | Lists all containers, including stopped ones.                              |


Accessing Nginx
You can access the Nginx server using the following URLs based on the port mapping:

http://localhost → When using -p 80:80
http://127.0.0.1:8080 → When using -p 8080:80
http://:8080 → When using -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 (in cloud or Docker playground)
To verify from inside the container:

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080

Command	                                 Description	                                    Access URL
docker run -dt -p 80:80 nginx	         Runs Nginx, maps port 80	                        http://localhost
docker run -dt -p 8080:80                nginx	Maps container port 80 to host port 8080	http://127.0.0.1:8080
docker run -p 0.0.0.0:8080:80 -dt        nginx	Binds to all interfaces                   	http://:8080


## Production / Background Tasks:


docker run -p 8080:80 -dt nginx

Runs in the background without blocking your terminal.

## Testing / Debugging:

docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
