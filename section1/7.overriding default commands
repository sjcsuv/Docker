# Overriding Default Container Commands in Docker

When you run a Docker container, it executes a **default command** defined in the image (e.g., `nginx` runs its web server). However, you can **override** this default command by specifying a new one at the end of the `docker container run` command.

---

## Example: Default Behavior

```bash
docker container run -d nginx

Example: Overriding the Default Command

docker container run -d nginx sleep 500

This overrides the default nginx command and runs sleep 500 instead.
The container will now stay alive for 500 seconds and then exit.

Inspecting and Interacting with the Container

docker container exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash

Install and run tools inside the container:

apt-get update
apt-get install htop
htop

exit
